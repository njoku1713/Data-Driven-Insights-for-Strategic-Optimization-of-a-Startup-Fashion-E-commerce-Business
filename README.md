### Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset from a Zukky Fashion, a startup e‑commerce clothing company, encompassing customer demographics, product performance, purchase history, logistics, and financial metrics. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize product offerings, and refine marketing and operational strategies. By identifying underperforming products and highlighting key customer and sales patterns, the project aims to foster efficiency, increase profitability, and secure a competitive edge for the business.

### Data Sources

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploring Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the HR data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are the dominant customer demographics (age, gender, location)??
- How do demographic characteristics relate to purchasing behavior?
- Which product categories and individual SKUs have the highest sales volume and revenue?
- What is the average order value per category?
- What are the lowest-performing product categories?
- What are the average order frequency and basket size per customer segment?
- Are there any seasonal or temporal trends in purchasing behavior?
- What is the average delivery time per order?
- What is the trend in revenue and sales growth over time?

### Results/Findings

Based on preliminary analysis, the results obtained are as follows:

1. The largest customer segment is the 18–30 age group, making up roughly 62% of total customers.
2. The “Casual” category accounted for 45% of revenue, with an average order value 30% higher than other categories.
3. Female customers dominate across age groups, representing approximately 65% of total customers. 
4. Shipments are concentrated in areas like Malaysia and Indonesia, suggesting these are primary markets.

### Recommendations

Based on the we recommend the following actions:
- Target marketing campaigns towards the 18–30 female demographic, as this group is highly active and responsive.
- Q4 sales momentum should be capitalized by intensifying marketing, introducing limited-time offers, and aligning product launches with seasonal trends.
- Low-performing product categories, such as Smart, Party, Travel, and Home should be faced out for products that match customer interests better.
- Continuous focus on robust payment gateways and security measures to sustain customer trust and maintain a low failed transaction rate.
- A predictive sales model should be developed for forecasting revenue and guiding inventory and staffing strategies.

### Limitations

Although this project provides valuable insights into e-commerce demographics and dynamics, it is subject to the following limitations:
1. The available data is only for annual aggregates between 2018 and 2022, thereby restricting the ability to assess long‑term trends or evaluate the sustainability of observed sales patterns.
2. The dataset provides basic demographics, such as age and gender but lacks deeper behavioral or psychographic details, making it challenging to segment customers beyond surface characteristics.
3. The analysis is primarily sales‑driven and doesn’t incorporate cost of goods sold, customer acquisition costs, or other profitability indicators, making it impossible to evaluate overall business health beyond top‑line revenues.
4. Detailed metrics such as customer lifetime value, repeat purchase behavior, and average transaction size per customer segment are not available, limiting the ability to craft highly targeted marketing and retention strategies.
